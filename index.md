I received my Ph.D. degree (21') from the Department of Computer Science at [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/). My research interests lie in the intersection of statistical machine learning, natural language processing and cognition. Current research themes include:
<!-- - **General Multimodal Perception:** General multimodal understanding, parsing and explainable modeling. -->
- **Human AI Alignment**: Building interactive models that align with human values and social norms.
- **Long-context Language Models:** Efficient training and inference of long-context language models.
- **Generative Modeling:** Statistical generative modeling (e.g. EBMs, diffusions) on high-dimensional data.

I am always looking for self-motivated **students** and long-term **collaborators**. Please contact me if you have excellent background or share similar research interests with me.
