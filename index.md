I am currently a **Visiting Researcher** at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), where I collaborate on research in long-context large language models, multimodal learning, and AI for science and medicine.

Concurrently, I am pursuing a **Ph.D. in Computer Science** at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/), under the supervision of Professor **Ligang He**.

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned my **MSc in Computer Science with Distinction** from **Newcastle University**, and a **BSc** degree from **Beijing Jiaotong University**.

In addition to my doctoral research, I am a doctoral exchange student at the **Alan Turing Institute**, and an active member of **CBAIA**, **UK-CSAE**, and **CLSS-UK**. These affiliations allow me to collaborate with leading researchers across disciplines and foster strong academic networks.

My research interests lie at the intersection of:

- **Information Retrieval (IR)**  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**  
- **AI for Science & Medicine**

I am particularly interested in responsible AI systems that align with human values, and in the development of interpretable models for scientific discovery and healthcare reasoning.

I am always open to collaboration with motivated **students** and **researchers**. Feel free to reach out if our interests align!
